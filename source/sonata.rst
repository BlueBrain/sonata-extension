SONATA circuit description
==========================

History
-------

The `SONATA` specification loosely defines a container interface to store
nodes and edges.  A full "definition" can be found in the official
specification_, this document will only refer to a subset of the `SONATA`
specification to instruct its use.

Objective
---------

The format should be used to disseminate files to the public.

File Format
-----------

The following is the practical definition of the files used in the
pipeline.

Populations
~~~~~~~~~~~

To distinguish between nodes and edges contained or connecting different
brain parts, we will use populations, as per the `SONATA` specification.
For simplicity, it is recommended to save each population in a separate
file.

For nodes, the following naming scheme is proposed::

    /nodes/${part}_${type}

Where ``${part}`` may be `NCX` for the neocortex, and ``${type}`` can
presently take the following values:

 - `neurons`
 - `astrocytes`

Examples::

    /nodes/thalamus_astrocytes
    /nodes/thalamus_neurons
    /nodes/ncx_astrocytes
    /nodes/ncx_neurons

Connectivity between these populations is directional, and edges will be
contained in populations specifying `source` and `target` node populations
as well as synapse type::

    /edges/${source_population}__${target_population}__${synapse_type}

If `source` and `target` population are identical, a single population may
also be bi-directional.

Currently, the following synapse types are supported:

 - `electrical`, also known as gap-junctions
 - `chemical`

Examples::

    /edges/thalamus_neurons__ncx_neurons__chemical

Fields for Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following attributes are mandatory as per specification and are used in the pipeline:

 - `x`, `y`, `z` stored as float in Î¼m:

       The position of the center of the soma in the local world.

 - `orientation_w`, `orientation_x`, `orientation_y`, `orientation_z`
   stored as float:

       Quaternion with the local world rotation of the morphology around the
       soma center.

 - `morphology` name, without file ending. The current implementation of
   connectome building expects a file ending in ``.h5``.

Furthermore, the following fields are required to be stored as an
`enumeration`_:

 - `etype`
 - `mtype`
 - `region`
 - `synapse_class`

As per `SONATA` specification, these values should be stored as integer
values and be resolved to strings.

Legacy fields that are not supported any longer:

 - `layer`, now contained within `mtype`
